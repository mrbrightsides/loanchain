## 🏗️ Architecture

### Loan Lifecycle States

```
Draft → Active → At Risk → Breach → Closed
         ↓
    (Normal completion)
         ↓
       Closed
```

**Status Definitions:**
- **Draft**: Loan being prepared, not yet active
- **Active**: Loan performing normally, all obligations met
- **At Risk**: Covenant breach warning or payment delay
- **Breach**: Formal breach of loan agreement
- **Closed**: Loan fully repaid or written off

### Smart Contract Structure

```solidity
contract LoanRegistry {
    struct Loan {
        address borrower;
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 interestRate;
        uint256 termMonths;
        string collateralType;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Loan) public loans;
    uint256 public loanCount;
    
    event LoanCreated(uint256 indexed loanId, ...);
